# Image-VideoFilter

### **Requirements:**
Using Swift, your assignment is to Build a small application that allows users to add filters to their videos.
This means they can hit the video button to record a video and then add filters either while recording or after (whichever is fastest for you to do) or
they can upload a video and then add filters on it. Keep a catalogue of the videos recorded or uploaded and edited on the homepage and 
store the metadata for it on firebase. Use OpenGL/Native Camera API on Android or AV Foundation on iOS for whichever platform you prefer to build for.
